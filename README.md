A "*just fine*" theme for blogging.

This clean theme

Suit up with `featured-image-headers` on posts and pages, each slickly presented with `custom-font` headings. The roomy footer is available for customisation with widgets.

This is a `two-columns` theme with a `right-sidebar`, `custom-menu`, `sticky-post`.
