The Captian of the Seas.

The WordPress theme for my personal blog.

### Features
- No sidebar (focus on the content!), Footer widgets, Featured images, Mobile view
- The theme will tile featured images if it detects that they are <= 873px. Works great with patterns from http://subtlepatterns.com/

### Todo
- Fix the massive TODO tag in the comments section!
- Increase line-width by a bit for the menus li's.
- [Mobile] header subtitle justification when << width.
- [Mobile] no navigation submenus.
- Search results shows snippets. Change to custom php template so less clunky.

### Tip
To stretch a background image to fill, use the following css with a custom css plugin:

    background-size: cover;

### Development

The `style.css` file is autogenerated (don't directly edit it). Rather, edit the `*.scss` files inside the scss directory, then run:

```
    compass compile
```
